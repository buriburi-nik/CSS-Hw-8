                <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</p>
                <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

                <p>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
                <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’d never written a line of code. I needed structure from professionals who could help me learn programming step by step. The curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on, and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project was outstanding and took my learning to the next level. I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It helped me land a job as a full-stack developer. 100% recommend! ”</p>

                <p>Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
                <p>“ The staff seemed genuinely concerned about my progress, which was refreshing. The program gave me the confidence to present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”</p>
